# ULTERA-contribute
A template repository for contributing to the ULTERA Database. You only need to restructure your data into a spreadsheet.

Simply:
1. Fork this repository (button in the top-right corner). Please add a unique identifier (not belonging to any other fork) to the fork's name, describing what you are uploading (`ULTERA-contribute-yourNameHere`), such as, e.g.:
   
    `-DuctilityDataAMK`, `-amkrajewski`, `-10.20517-jmi.2021.05`, or `-jmi2021adetal`. 
2. See how the sample template is filled. The fields have short descriptions and examples above them. 
Note: If you only have phase stability data, you can leave the property field blank.

4. Fill out the template with data. Do not hesitate to open an issue in this (source) repository in case you have any questions!
   
5. Let us know you are ready! We will clone your forked repository as a submodule and automatically process the data to ULTERA.
