# ULTERA-contribute
A template repository for contributing to the ULTERA Database. You only need to restructure your data into a spreadsheet.

Simply:
1. Fork this repository (button in the top-right corner). Please add a unique identifier (not belonging to any other fork) to the fork's name, i.e., ULTERA-contribute`-yourNameHere`, such as, e.g.:
   
    `-AlloyDataAMK`, `-amkrajewski`, `-10.20517-jmi.2021.05`, or `-jmi2021adetal`.
   
   Please note that on a personal GitHub account, you can only have a single fork of a repository; thus, if you want to upload data from multiple sources, it is advisable to follow one of the first two examples above. Then, you can keep each source in a separate spreadsheet.
   
3. See how the sample template is filled. The fields have short descriptions and examples above them. The `templateSampleFilled_v4.xlsx` contains some filled examples.

4. Remove the `templateSampleFilled_v4.xlsx` sample file (just to keep things neat) and rename `template_v4.xlsx` to something describing what you are uploading and that will help you remember what is inside, e.g., `refractory_bcc_heas`, `CrMoNiBased_DuctilityAndHardness`, `HardnessCollectionHEA` or, for single-publication data, the DOI `10.20517-jmi.2021.05`. Avoid putting the version number or year in the name, as it will make correcting errors in the datasets much more difficult.


5. Fill out the spreadsheet with your data. Do not hesitate to [open an issue in this (source) repository](https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/ULTERA-contribute/issues) in case you have any questions!

   Note: If you only have phase stability data, you can leave the property field blank.

6. (optional/recommended) Enable the `Issues` page for your fork by (1) going to `Settings`, (2) scrolling down to `Features`, and (3) checking the box next to Issues. This will allow others to let you know if they find any problems with your data, or just want to ask questions.
   
7. Let us know your data is ready! We will clone your forked repository as a submodule and automatically process the data to ULTERA.
